# Leetcode

These are my works for leetcodes problems. I completed around 100 exercises in early 2020. Prevously, I mainly used C++ in order to fully taste the problems. Recently, I keep making progress on more exercises using python. During the progress, I can sometimes came up with top ranked algorithm myself. When my solution was slow, I learned insights from the forum, and then implemented them myself.
